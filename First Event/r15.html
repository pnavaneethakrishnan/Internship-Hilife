        <p>Yamaha bike price starts from Rs. 78,435. Yamaha offers 10 new models in India with most popular bikes being R15 V4, MT 15 V2 and FZ S FI. The upcoming bikes of Yamaha include YZF R1M, MT 03 and XSR 155. Most expensive Yamaha bike is R15 V4, which is priced at Rs. 1,78,200.

            Yamaha derived its name from Torakusu Yamaha, the company’s founder. It started off by manufacturing Western musical instruments in Japan back 1887, and it wasn’t till 1955 that the company’s motorcycle division was set up. While Yamaha still manufactures musical instruments, with the distinction of being regarded as one of the leading names in the field, it also forms one fourth of the big four Japanese manufacturers in the two-wheeler industry.
            
            With a rich legacy of motorcycle racing under its belt, Yamaha gained fame for its two-stroke motorcycles which exceled in premier class racing. Be it superbikes or motocross, Yamaha became one of the best manufacturers to bank on. Even today, Yamaha continues to be one of the top dogs across different forms of two-wheeler racing. This success in racing has helped Yamaha establish its name across the globe, making it one of the biggest two-wheeler manufacturers in the world.</p>
